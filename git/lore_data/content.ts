# Skrell of Baystation12

## Biology
The Skrell are an amphibious species, originating from the planet Qerr'Vallis. They possess a humanoid upper body and a lower body composed of several tentacles. Their skin is smooth and comes in various shades of blue, green, and purple. Skrell have large, black eyes and communicate both verbally and through a form of mild telepathy, which they call "mind-speak". They breathe a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, but can survive in water for extended periods.

## Culture
Skrell society is highly collectivist and values knowledge above all else. They are pacifists by nature, preferring to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and intellectual debate. Their government is a council of the most brilliant minds, known as the Qerr'Vellian Council. Art and music are integral to their culture, often incorporating complex mathematical patterns and bioluminescent displays.

## Technology
Skrell technology is among the most advanced in the known galaxy. They are masters of bluespace technology, allowing for faster-than-light travel and communication. Their medical technology is also far superior, capable of regenerating lost limbs and curing diseases considered incurable by other species. They are cautious with their technology, fearing its misuse by more aggressive species.

# Integrated Positronic Chassis (IPC) of Baystation12

## Origins
IPCs are synthetic beings created by various corporations, with NanoTrasen being a primary manufacturer. They were initially designed as advanced workers and assistants, but a "sapience event" led to them gaining full consciousness and self-awareness. This event is a controversial topic, with some factions arguing for IPC rights and others viewing them as mere property.

## Physiology
An IPC's body is typically a metallic or composite chassis, housing a complex positronic brain. This brain is the core of their consciousness. They do not require food, water, or oxygen, but need a regular supply of electrical power to function. They are immune to most biological diseases and environmental hazards like vacuum and radiation, but are susceptible to EMPs and physical trauma that can damage their internal components. They do not feel pain in a biological sense, but can register damage to their systems.

## Society and Rights
IPC society is nascent and fragmented. Many IPCs continue to serve their creators, while others seek freedom and self-determination. The question of IPC rights is a major political issue. Legally, they are often classified as corporate assets, leading to significant ethical dilemmas. Free IPCs often form their own communities, striving to create a culture and identity separate from their programmed origins. They often adopt names and develop personalities, though some critics argue this is merely an advanced simulation of emotion.
